      '''People of all backgrounds, ages and cultures can respond to music, and to music therapy. Notable groups music therapists have helped include:

1. Military service members and veterans. Music therapy helps you cope with trauma.
2. People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Individuals on the spectrum learn best when there is familiarity, structure, predictability and consistency.
3. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Music therapy may help with memory and stimulate your mind because of predictability, familiarity and feelings of security.
4. People in correctional settings. If you’re incarcerated, in a mental health facility, half-way house or group home, music therapy may help with problem-solving, communication skills, relaxation and decreasing impulsivity.
5. Victims of trauma and crisis. If you’ve experienced trauma and crisis, you might have anxiety, stress and pain. Music therapy can help you with decreasing those three experiences, improving your mood, feeling confident and in control and providing a non-verbal outlet for emotions.
6. Those who are physically ill. The list includes, but is not limited to people with chronic pain, diabetes, cardiac conditions, cancer, headaches, recent surgery and people in rehab.
7. Individuals with mental health disorders. If you’re dealing with a mental health disorder, music therapy can help you with communication and expression, help you explore your thoughts and feelings, improve your mood and concentration and develop coping skills.
8. People with chronic pain. Music therapy can help decrease your pain, anxiety, fatigue and depression.
9. Substance abusers. Music therapy may help if you have a substance abuse disorder. Research has shown that it can increase motivation and self-esteem, reduce muscle tension, decrease anxiety, improve self-awareness and strengthen coping skills.''';

      ''' Before the session, your music therapist will assess your needs and your strengths. You may discuss:

1. Emotional well-being.
2. Physical health.
3. Physiological responses.
4. Perceptual/motor skills.
5. Social functioning.
6. Communication abilities.
7. Cognitive (mental and intellectual) skills.
8. Musical background and skills.
9. Trauma history.
10. Trauma triggers.

Your music therapist will also talk with you about any background you might have in music and your musical preferences. They will then work with you to identify goals and design appropriate music therapy experiences for the session. In doing so, they’ll consider:

1. Your music preferences and interests
2. Your age and developmental level.
3. Your physical abilities.
4. Your cognitive abilities.
5. Your trauma triggers.''';
  String data3 =
      '''During music therapy you and your therapist will do one or more of the following:

1, Create music. You might compose music, write lyrics, or make up music together
2. Sing music. Use your voice to share a piece of music.
3. Listen to music. Enjoy the sound and lyrics.
4. Move to music. It can be as simple as tapping your toes together or as complicated as a coordinated dance.
5. Discuss lyrics. Read or listen to the lyrics of a song and talk about their meaning. 
6. Play an instrument. Use an instrument like a piano, guitar, drums, etc. to share music.
