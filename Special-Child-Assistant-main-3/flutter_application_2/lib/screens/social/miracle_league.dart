      ''' Every player bats once each inning
All players are safe on the bases
Every player scores a run before the inning is over (last one up gets a home run)
Community children and volunteers serve as “buddies” to assist the players as they bat and field the ball
Each team and each player wins every game''';
  String data3 =
      '''The Miracle League removes the barriers that keep children with mental and physical disabilities off the baseball field and lets them experience the joy of America’s favorite pastime. Since the main barriers for these adults arise from the natural grass fields used in conventional leagues, Miracle League teams play on a custom-designed, rubberized turf field that accommodates wheelchairs and other assertive devices while helping to prevent injuries.

But it’s more than playing a game. The Miracle League is about making new friends, building self-esteem and being treated just like other athletes.  To help the athletes, the Miracle League uses a “buddy” system – pairing each player with an able-bodied peer.  The result is a bond that cannot be described. The Miracle League serves children and adults who suffer from any physical or mental disabilities, which causes them to be excluded, whether intentionally or not, from conventional Baseball leagues.

The first Miracle League field opened in Conyers, Georgia in April 2000.  Word spread and by 2002, fields opened in South Carolina, Alabama, West Virginia, Illinois, and California. There are   presently 240 plus Miracle League Organizations across the country including Puerto Rico and Canada, while serving 200,000 plus children and adults.

The Miracle League has an aggressive plan to help local communities  build Miracle League complexes around the globe.''';
